     * This is the central method of the whole Dataflow engine as it executes the patches.
     *
     * A breath first search over the entire graph is done, starting from the rootSet.
     * All patches that have no connected inlets are part of the rootSet.
     *
     * The algorith is the follow
     *
     * 1) push all elements from the root set into the execution queue
     *
     * 2) dequeue a patch from the execution queue
     * 3) if execution criteria is met execute it *1
     * 4) propagate the values of all changed outlets and add the receiving patches to the discovered set *2 *3
     * 5) goto to step 2 if the execution queue is not empty
     * 6) move all elements from the discovered set to the execution queue
     * 7) goto step 2 if the execution queue is not empty
     * 8) finish the frame
     *
     * *1 right now the only criteria is 'execute allways'
     * *2 outlet values propagation and patch enqueuing are done from first to last outlet.
     * *3 order of discovery is maintained during execution.
