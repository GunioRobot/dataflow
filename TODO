----- TODO -----

* Self-documenting API

* Auto-discover patches inside a .NET assembly

* Type casting between inlets and outlets - how do we create inlets that support mulitple types?

* Mandatory default, optional min and max values for inlets, overflow and underflow checks (throws exception? logs to console? explodes?)

* Explore how to build GUI (Gtk? Gdk? Cairo? X?)

* Figure out serialized format for patches / UI <-> Engine comms protocol
